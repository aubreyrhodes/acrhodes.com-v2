title: A Week Without Time
---

So, while driving to Augusta this weekend, I was listening to the [Radiolab episode on time](http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/29/). That got me thinking about my relationship to time in my daily life. READMORE Generally that involves my waking up in the morning, seeing that I'm awake earlier than I 'need' to be, going back to sleep. I then wake up at a time that makes me feel guilty, about two hours later. From there I generally spend the rest of the day with one eye constantly on the clock, fretting over how much time I have until my next meeting, lunch or when I need to go home to check on the dog. All in all, I spend hours each week thinking about what time it actually is.

In an effort to try to escape the drudgery of checking the clock, I'm attempting an experiment. My goal is to try and spend as much of my time in the next 7 days not knowing what time it is. This isn't to say that I won't make it to any meetings or keep any plans, I just don't want to care about what the actual minute is. Here's the plan:

  *  Hide all of the clocks I possibly can. I've used [Omega Status Bar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calsto.omega.statusbar&hl=en) to hide the clock from the status bar of my android phone as well as hiding the clocks from my mac book menu bar and my tmux configuration. I still need to figure out what to do with the clock on my oven…
  *  Setup reminders for anything where I need to meet other people with enough warning for me to actually get there when expected. To me this is almost switching from polling to push notifications for events… in my mind. Hopefully this will free up some mental bandwidth for more important things, like tacos.

We'll see what if anything changes. Hopefully I won't end up trying to go to the grocery store at 2am.
