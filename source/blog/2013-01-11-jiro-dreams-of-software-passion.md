title: Jiro Dreams of Software - Be Passionate About Your Work
---
When I think about a passionate developer, I think about one that is excited to be doing what they do. For me, it's getting to wake up in the morning and know that I get to build something that day. It's a great feeling.READMORE

Additionaly, I think that a passionate developer gets offended when things aren't quite right (or more often, blatantly broken). Once you [care about what you are doing](/blog/2013/01/07/jiro-dreams-of-software-serious.html) and you have experienced things done the right way, it should feel painful to compromise on your standards.

I'm not really sure there's a grey area here either. You can't be ambivalent about what you're doing and be great at it at the same time. You really need to drink the coolade and go all in. Finding yourself unconcerned with the quality of your work should serve as a sign that it may be time to move on.

The economics of the industry mean that there are people working in the field right now that are just in it for the money, which is fine. It is totally understandable that some people just want to make a living. I think that this means that we will have less great developers percentage wise, but maybe more great developers overall.

I suspect that this means that many other developers don't find the role as fulfilling as I do. I'm not sure if I could do this if I wasn't excited and passionate about it, though. It's just more fun this way.
