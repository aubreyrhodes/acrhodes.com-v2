Since I've exhausted episodes of _Portlandia_ and _Parks and Recreation_ on Netflix, I've started watching some documentaries. By far, one of my favorite that I've seen recently has been [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/), which depicts sushi master Jiro Ono and his resturant. READMORE In the documentary, Jiro lists his five things one should do to be a great sushi chef:

2.  [Aspire to improve](blog/2013/01/08/jiro-dreams-of-software-improve.html)
3.  [Maintain cleanliness](/blog/2013/01/09/jiro-dreams-of-software-cleanliness.html)
4.  [Be a better leader than a collaborator](/blog/2013/01/10/jiro-dreams-of-software-leadership.html)
5.  [Be passionate about your work](/blog/2013/01/11/jiro-dreams-of-software-passion.html)

Being a software developer, I am constantly comparing my work to other professions to see what I can learn, and the idea of being compared to a sushi chef is very appealing. It has been my observation that writing software can been seen less of an act of engineering or science and more of one of craftsmanship. In this spirit, I'm going to devote the next five blog posts to picking apart Jiro's five attributes and seeing how they can apply to the craft of software.
