title: This Ain't Your Mother's Particle Collider

Your grandfathers didn't have feuds about using a relational database over a NoSQL solution. Your family doesn't cozy up around a fire every Christmas and write webapps using an MVC framework. These situations don't make any sense, but developers still talk about best practices as "traditions." In general, I'm a pretty laid back person, but this really drives me up the wall. 

A tradition is a habit, an act that is repeated time after time because you enjoy the ceremony of it. You like drinking a beer with the same friend every Thursday night, or you enjoy sacrificing the same type of goat every year when the harvest comes in. 

However, this is not (or absolutely should not be) the reason that best practices in software exist.

Best practices are a convention, and they are followed because they are generally thought to be the most effective. They can also be changed without any emotional cost&mdash;and that's important. When a technology comes along and proves to be better, you shouldn't pine for the good old days, when you used to use an inferior solution.

So it bugs me when someone says "We're switching from a traditional MySQL database to PosgreSQL," because it's not a tradition that is being changed. You can argue that I'm being a curmudgeon, but words are important. They shape the way we think. If you're being sentimental in the way you describe best practices, you're going to get attached to them. And then you'll get left behind.
