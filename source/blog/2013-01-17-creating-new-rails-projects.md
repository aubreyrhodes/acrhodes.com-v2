title: Creating New Rails Projects
---

Over the last year, I've spent a lot of time setting up new rails projects and tweaking them to be setup just how I like. Around July of last year, I started working on a generator project to setup projects exactly how I like them with just one command.READMORE After the [Big Nerd Ranch / Highgroove merger](http://highgroove.com/big-nerd-ranch.html), I migrated what was then the highgroove_generator gem to the new [bnr_generator gem](https://github.com/bignerdranch/bnr-generator). There's still plenty of work to do on it, but I find it a very useful tool.

If you'd like to learn more about the motivations behind it, here's the slide deck for a presentation I gave on the project last year to [ATLRUG](http://www.atlrug.com/).
