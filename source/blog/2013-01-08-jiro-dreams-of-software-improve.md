title: Jiro Dreams of Software - Aspire to Improve
---
I like to think of Jiro's second Attribute, "Aspire to Improve", as liberating in a way. Instead of focusing on doing the right thing perfectly right now, you are freed up to try something. If you know you are improving things as you go you can ship something without being perfectly happy with it and make it better as you go along. By committing yourself to improve bit by bit over time, you are free to get stuff done.

This also get's talked about from a software management point of view. Coming from Toyota, the idea of [Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) has turned into [Iterative Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development) where projects start and then go through a state of constant improvements over time. Again, this frees you to adjust the project over time, getting it closer an closer to what you actually need.

Currently, I am very fortunate to be surrounded by dedicated and talented developers. It's not a coincidence that they all have at least one facet of their skills that they are working to improve with their current projects.
