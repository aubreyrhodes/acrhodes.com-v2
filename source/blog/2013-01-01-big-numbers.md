title: Big Numbers

I'm a big fan of using goals to stretch yourself personally. 2012 was, I think, my most successful year so far and I think a lot of the reason for that was the goals I set for myself last January. I'll recap what those goals were and weather or not I reached them tomorrow, but without further ado, here are my personal goals for 2013:

1.  Run 500 miles
2.  Write 300 blog posts
3.  Read 25 books

I've picked these because they are trivially easy to measure, and address three things that I want to improve in myself. Goals with a specific number attached to them, because they turn your resolutions into a game. If the goal was just 'read more' or 'get in better shape' I would have some wiggle room to get out of actually doing the work, but this year I'll know that if I'm not averaging 10 miles of running a week, I'm going to be off my mark.
