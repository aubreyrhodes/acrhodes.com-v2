title: Jiro Dreams of Software - Be a Better Leader Than a Collaborator
---
To be honest, this is the only attribute out of [the list](/blog/2013/01/06/jiro-dreams-of-software.html) that I have a hard time recommending a developer to be. I finally realized that Jiro's list is not for Sushi chefs that would be great to work with, or chefs that would make the best employees or even chefs that are the happiest. He's talking about chefs that are remarkable and practice their craft better than their peers.

By this measure, I can think of a number of software developers that are visionaries and thought leaders, but are not great collaborators. Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, is notoriously abrasive, but has made monumental contributions to the open source movement. David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of rails, is another example. Even Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of the ruby language who is generally regarded as a nice guy, can be uncompromising when it comes to his ruby implementation.

I don't think it's wise to be hard to work with for no reason. However, I do think there is a time and place to realize that you need to go with your gut. Being uncompromising, in moderation, can be a good thing for a developer with great vision.
