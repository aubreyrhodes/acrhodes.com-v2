title: Results from my Week Without Time
---
[Last Month](/blog/2012/12/10/a-week-without-time.html) I had an idea for an experiment and decided to spend a week trying not to know what time it is. I did end up making it through the week without any watch and the time hidden on my phone and computer. It was definitely an interesting experience, but not something I'd like to do all the time.

It's equally liberating and surreal to not spend the day worrying about what minute it is. I was never quite sure when to head to bed, so instead of waiting for an appropriate time I just went to bed when I ran out of things to do. Instead of working until "quitting time", I worked until I wasn't being productive anymore. Everything seems a little more relaxed.

For meetings, I still scheduled everything with a specific time, but instead of watching the clock I just set reminders for myself in my calendar. I did end up forgetting to set a reminder for one appointment and was a few minutes late. That one instance aside, my meetings and appointments that week were not any different from the week before.

As for getting work done, I ended up spending a little less time being productive, but getting just as much done:

Even without know now long I was was working, I was still pretty consistent and I still got my job done. All in all, it is a little in convenient to go around not knowing what time it is, but it is nice to know that it's not absolutely necessary.
