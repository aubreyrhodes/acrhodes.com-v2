title: Last Year's Goals
---
So [yesterday](/blog/2013/01/01/big-numbers.html) I talked about my new goals for 2013, but today I'm going to recap how I did on my 2012 goals: READMORE

#### Buy a New House
This was the first goal I completed, moving into my new place in April. I was pretty nervous about the amount of commitment this represented, but I couldn't be happier with the house or the new location in the Old Forth Ward. If you considering looking to buy in Atlanta I would definitely recommend my [realtor](http://www.coldwellbankeratlanta.com/real_estate_agent/696/Rocky-Seaman.aspx?RegionID=0&IsFromAgentSrch=True&AlphabetSearchChar=S&SortColumn=LastName&PageNumber=2&StateID=15) and my [mortgage broker](http://business.albanyga.com/list/member/america-s-first-mortgage-lending-company-albany-6362).

#### Adopt a Dog
By far, this was the best decision I made all year. I adopted Ernest in June and he's been my best friend ever since. If you've got a flexible schedule and enough space, I would definitely recommend adopting a mutt.

#### Workout 150 Times
While I know that I completed this one, I did not track this as well as I could have. Since all of my goals this year include some numeric value, I think it will be more motivating if I track them closer. In spite of that, I think this went very well. In addition to picking up running and finishing my first half marathon, I lost 25lbs. If you are serious about working out more and getting in shape, think about working with a personal trainer. I know that made all the difference for me.

#### Start a Business
I think that this is the only goal I didn't complete last year. While I do have paying customers for [I Need A Toothbrush](http://ineedatoothbrush.com), I still haven't publicly launched the service. The reason I haven't made more progress is that I'm taking the business on as a side project. I've always had trouble with keeping up momentum on these types of projects. Hopefully that will improve in 2013.
